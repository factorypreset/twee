About Story Formats
</h1>

<p>
A story format controls the behavior, and to a degree, the appearance of your story
once it's built and viewed in a Web browser. Each story format's fonts and colors
can be customized for your story.

<p>
<b>Sugarcane</b><br />
Each passage is displayed one at a time to the reader, and certain passages can be
rewound to through a menu.
</p>

<p>
<b>Jonah</b><br />
All passages are displayed on a single page that expands as the reader clicks links.
</p>

<p>
<b>TiddlyWiki 2 and TiddlyWiki 1</b><br />
These formats allow you to publish to the format that Jonah and Sugarcane are based on.
They are general-purpose wikis that can be easily browsed and modified.
