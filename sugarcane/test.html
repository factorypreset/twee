It feels as though there's a fire in her stomach -- no, more like knives caught there, trying to force their way out with every breath, trying to air out her innards. She wraps her arms around her middle, to keep her breathing shallow, and walks as fast as she can manage down the trail.\n\nMallory counts back the landmarks to the parking lot: the narrow turn, the dinosaur rock, the rows of barbecue grills wasting away into rust. If only she could stop and look at any of this it would all feel so much more malleable. No. The other word that starts with an M... there's no time to think of it.\n\nWhen her feet touch parliament, she breaks into a scurry for her car, a dumb little parody of a little girl rushing to the bathroom after a movie. She can't even walk that fast, her joints won't allow it. It is absurd, the idea of driving now. But it was just as [[absurd]] coming up here, and she managed that. She feels proud, inexplicably, when she hears [[the engine turn over]].</div><div tiddler="it's on fire" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">When the house was broken into four days later, Peter was sure the visitors were real after all. He had found the house with his mother; she drove him home from day care and found the front door hanging loosely from its hinges. They went to a neighbor's and called the police but when they came, there was no one inside, and stranger-- nothing had been taken. People used all kinds of words to describe it but Peter alone knew what had happened.\n\nHis parents had washed the symbol he had drawn from the wall as best they could, but if you looked at it from the right angle, the light would catch where it had been. Peter could see it anytime he wanted.\n\nHe reaches a small stream that turns like a sleepless child across the hillside. It's too wide to jump and there are no rocks to step over, so he takes off his socks and shoes and wades across. The water comes up perhaps halfway up his calves and little plumes of mud come up as he walks, like he's a giant wrecking cities with every step. He begins walking barefoot on [[the other side]], doesn't mind at all.</div><div tiddler="seven" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">Other things going wrong with me today, more serious than just words.

She won't let me do this.\n\nBut... think of it this way. Every day can be a little step.

My daughter took me to lunch afterwards at an outdoors cafe that would have made for great peoplewatching if I could have focused on it. She tries very hard to do normal things with me now. Sometimes I think this is maybe the only way to handle this. Other times it feels absurd, over and over again.\n\nSo -- we had expensive sandwiches on ciabatta bread (I love the difference in how you spell and say the word) and I have a degenerative brain disease. I don't want to write its name down yet. We need a second opinion anyway. But if it's happening, it could go quickly or it could go slowly. No one knows and there is no way to tell except by waiting a couple months and measuring what I lose. We had iced tea that was blood-red and tasted like citrus, and somehow that detail seemed to calm my mind, so that I could regard the world as a hummingbird might. The doctor told me that regardless of how fast it happens, someday I'll lose everything. I might wake up one morning colorblind or unable to see at all. It might go after my speech center first. There was someone playing music at the cafe, someone singing and strumming on a guitar, but although I could hear the melody, I couldn't remember what song it was.\n\n&lt;&lt;back 'Click'&gt;&gt; [[Next &raquo;|fin]]</div><div tiddler="four" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">My daughter took off work this week and we went to Cape May, where we used to go on vacations every year before the kids grew up.

In one of the cupholders a cell phone is buzzing and playing a steady bass drum beat. The screen reads: [[Hurricane Tami]]. The ringtone is a warning. The driver glances up at the rear view but the [[guy in the back]] is staring out the window, so he taps the bluetooth in his ear and takes a deep breath he hopes she won't hear over the phone.\n\nTami doesn't bother with hellos. Instead she launches into the same argument she's been having with herself all month long. She states her case and doesn't even pause to let him say anything, just says the things she thinks he'd say back to her. He would never say the things she puts in his mouth but that isn't really relevant. The light turns green and he turns left, towards the highway. Traffic is light tonight and it's a nice early spring evening, so he has his window open. He feels in tune with things. Tami's voice in his ear is like the ocean, [[eternal and meaningless]].</div><div tiddler="I got ripped off before" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">This isn't true, but it's better than saying you don't trust a guy. You can't say things like that. This is business.\n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="Who the fuck are you?" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">The man said this in real life, too, and the only thing that hurt Jameel in a way he hadn't been before was that he recognized the man in an instant. He didn't know his face but he knew that he had to be from [[Tami's office]], so many guys she talked about to him, told so many stories about them they melted into a single long confusing story -- and she always told him he looked stupid when he turned jealous -- \n\n&quot;I hate you,&quot; he says, and his hands clench into fists though something tugs at him. He has heard something without knowing it. Anthony, his son, coming behind him, hearing the noise of the door opening but not sure what it means. [[Anthony the sleepless]]. Jameel stops himself. Tami's awake now but silent. He can only see her eyes. The rest of her is gone. Jameel does nothing. He can't now.\n\n(There is one thing:\n\n&quot;Why?&quot;\n\nBut he doesn't think to ask this. And once the moment passes he can't ask.)\n\nHe turns and pushes his way out of the apartment, out of the building. The doors struggle against him this time. They want to trap him. Once he's outside, it takes time for the dream to catch up to him, to remember that there were monsters before. The streets are blank rectangles of asphalt that lead nowhere. The buildings are empty packing crates, with the outlines of doors and window stenciled onto the wood. There. The monsters are here now. Finally. Their jaws are a relief.\n\nTami watches from the window. As they eat him up, she says through the glass, &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; and if this weren't a dream he wouldn't be able to hear. But this is one, and now he knows it. He wakes up and the sky is [[full of stars over him]], and he almost cries but catches himself in time.\n\nDid he love her at all? Was he just waiting for this to happen? He knows the answer to this question but he won't speak it, not even to himself.</div><div tiddler="the last few feet" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">He sits at the peak of the hill and stares at the dying sunset, [[waiting]].</div><div tiddler="the door" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">Tami is a sound sleeper. Nothing wakes her up. She's so stupid that way. There she is. There [[he]] is. He knows this would happen but it still cuts deep. His arm around her waist. His hand descending to where no one can see. The sheets are covered in red airplanes. Jameel is making these details up. Tami was at the door. The guy inside was hiding in the bathroom. She tried to talk Jameel into going to bed straight away. Why is he doing this? He knows it is his dream but he cannot control it.\n\nThe man in bed with Tami opens his eyes and asks, &quot;[[Who the fuck are you?]]&quot;</div><div tiddler="Follow the man into the woods" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">She knows you're not supposed to go into the woods to meet people, but when she sees him sitting on the rock at the foot of the trail to the ridge, tying his shoes, she can't help but say hello.\n\n&quot;Oh, hi,&quot; he says. He's dressed a little oddly for a hike -- looks like he just got off work, but then the weather is really bounded today, mid-seventies with high fluffy clouds like rabbits. Even though it's past six, it feels more like late afternoon than evening. No reason not to get out as soon as you can.\n\n&quot;How are you?&quot; she asks, because she can't think of anything better to say.\n\n&quot;I'm fine and you?&quot;\n\n&quot;I'm doing well considering.&quot;\n\nHe doesn't ask about it. On any other day, she would keep moving, count it as just a simple conversation. But she pushes on: &quot;Are you going to the top?&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; he says.\n\n&quot;Want to come with me?&quot;\n\nHe smiles, who knows why exactly. &quot;[[Sure.]]&quot;</div><div tiddler="did this to himself" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">It takes a minute to jiggle the bathroom doorknob again but then he is walking down the hallway, trying to be quiet as he can. Anthony's got school in the morning. He pushes a matchbox car down the hall away from him with a toe. He's done this fifteen times before and the toys are always in the same places. He's at the bedroom door. It's closed.\n\n&quot;Do you want to go in?&quot; his father asks. Of course it's his father. Everyone talks to their father in their dreams.\n\n&quot;[[Why wouldn't I?]]&quot; Jameel asks. &quot;I'm tired.&quot;\n\nHe tries it but it's locked.\n\n&quot;What's going on?&quot; he asks.\n\nHis father hands him [[a key]]. &quot;You had to knock on the door to get her to open it for you. This is different from how it happened. You should do this yourself.&quot;\n\nHe opens [[the door]].</div><div tiddler="eternal and meaningless" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">The guy in the back still doesn't say anything, even after they hit 54. &quot;Honey, hold on, I gotta call you back,&quot; he says. &quot;I gotta get directions.&quot; She doesn't seem to hear him so he keeps imploring, &quot;honey, honey, honey.&quot; The words don't mean anything to him. He just needs to get her attention. If she thinks he hung up on her, she'll call back. &quot;Honey. Honey. I'll call you back.&quot;\n\nShe asks the only question she ever asks: &quot;Are you coming home tonight?&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; he says more casually than he means to. He should've paused so she could think that he had to think about it. Or that he was still unsure. He was so good at telling her what she wanted to hear before. [[What did he lose?]] He doesn't know where to begin.</div><div tiddler="Sure." tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">The beginning of [[the trail]] is the steepest part. It arcs up and down the face of a hill, curving around clumps of trees that lean downward like oaks mated with weeping willows. If today weren't today she'd be able to make it up without any trouble -- but it's a special day, is the only way she can think of it. She knows he can go faster than she can, but he keeps his pace even with hers. He's quiet, too, only asks a few polite questions as they ascend. It feels -- what's the word? -- gentlemanly. She imagines herself carrying a [[parasol]].\n\n&quot;I've been trying to think of this word all day,&quot; she says. &quot;It starts with an H and it means, um, like, peacefulness, or being cheerful.&quot;\n\n&quot;Happiness?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, I mean yes, that works but it's a different one I'm trying to think of.&quot;\n\n&quot;I'm sorry, I'm not really good at remembering words.&quot;\n\nShe laughs -- perhaps too quickly, revealing too much. But if he takes any more meaning from it than its face value, he shows no sign of it. (Gentlemanly. She fixes the word in her mind as [[the path flattens a bit]]).</div><div tiddler="his watch" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">Time has never made sense to Peter. The human conception of it, that is -- how there are twenty-four hours in a day, sixty minutes in an hour, thirty-sometimes-thirty-one-rarely-twenty-eight days in a month. Who decided these numbers? Who carved out these spaces? He purchased his watch on a whim one day, nearly six months after his first job out of college. He liked the work there. He made numbers all his own, and they followed patterns he designed in his spreadsheets. \n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="full of stars over him" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">It takes him a minute to find himself again, remember what he was doing. There was a guy he was waiting for but he didn't come back. He must not have. It's way too late. It doesn't matter. The hundred dollar bill. It's in his left pants pocket. He feels it crumpled up in there. Relieved. Okay. He's out of breath but didn't notice it till now. \n\nHe gets back into the taxi. The clock says 10:10 when he turns the engine on and it feels like a sign, but he doesn't know of what. He doesn't normally believe in signs. He goes back into the city, drives a few more fares to round out the night, quits early before the bars close. He can't handle it. The road back to dispatch is hellish. The lights in the buildings he passes on the way back home feel like a carnival and people are screaming. When he can pick out a single voice it sounds happy, but together they're just an angry, hungry howl. He keeps waiting for the dream to click back on but it won't. He wishes he could go back to it now. He cuts down a side street, one he doesn't know, but it's simple enough to find his way and it's also quieter, which he needs.\n\nHe signs out for the night and heads into the back to the cot. It's a favor [[the owner]]'s doing for him. Takes off his shirt and pants and tries to find the way to curl up that makes the cot comfortable. There is a way. He's done it before. The back room is tight, full of old boxes of paperwork, smells like paper, dying paper, and the air is still and just tangibly humid. Sleep. You tell your mind that enough times and it will. Close your eyes. Think about -- think about some other place. Don't dream. People aren't supposed to remember their dreams.\n\n[[Sleep]].</div><div tiddler="Hansel and Gretel" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">They asked him to draw a complex symbol on his bedroom wall. They guided him line by line, and told him how important it was that everything be symmetrical. The symbol would protect Peter and his family, the male visitor explained. The female one said that bad people were watching his house, and the symbol would keep everyone safe from them. When he finished, the visitors asked him to climb back in bed and close his eyes. They weren't allowed to touch him and they couldn't let him see them leave, either.\n\nOf course his parents were angry the next morning when they saw the drawing all over the wall, and of course he didn't try to explain what had happened. He was not entirely sure that the visitors were real; even though he was only three or four years old, his mind was beginning to divide [[true from false]].\n\nAt the next trail branch he finds, Peter takes off [[his watch]] and wraps it around a branch of a tree. It is nearly dark and the metal of the watch glows as if [[it's on fire]].</div><div tiddler="the other side" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">It was several weeks before the visitors came again, and when they did, they wore the same clothes they had before, and acted as if it had only been a very short time since they had last talked to Peter.\n\n&quot;Are you my real parents?&quot; he asked.\n\nThey looked at each other and sighed, as if he had asked a question he wasn't supposed to. They shook their heads in unison and asked him to get his crayon. This time he would need a piece of paper, too. They had him draw a map of someplace he did not know. They could not touch him, they reminded him, so they modelled the contours of hills and rivers by moving their arms through the air. Then they explained where each town should be labelled: Olla, the emerald city on the west coast, and Attenpound its twin on the opposite shore. Routon, they told him, was the capital of the country, though when he asked what country it was exactly, they spoke a sound he could not understand.\n\nFinally they had him draw a star on the map at a point nowhere in particular -- not near one town or another. &quot;What should I call this?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;Home,&quot; they said together.\n\n&quot;My real home?&quot;\n\nThey shook their heads again and told him that they could not explain it to him, but if he should ever get into trouble, bigger trouble than his parents could help him with, he should go to the starry point, and they would help him. And then they asked him to climb into bed and close his eyes again. He did, but when he thought they wouldn't be looking, he opened his eyes again. The visitors were outside his window again, looking at him -- and they had the faces of his parents. The moment he saw them, he shut his eyes again tightly, terrified.\n\nThe last thing he loses is his shirt -- a collared one he liked to wear to work. It's a nice shade of green that seems to complement his skin. But he doesn't need it anymore, and perhaps [[he doesn't even want it]], if he were to think about it the way people ought to about clothes. His undershirt clings to his torso -- he's been sweating but hasn't noticed it.</div><div tiddler="eleven" tags="" modified="200809062042" created="200809062042" modifier="twee">I have to go now, while my daughter is out buying food.

She can see the road ahead but none of the scenery. The yellow double line is the most vivid thing she has now. She lets go of the gas pedal and lets the car drive itself forward. Mallory's house pulls into view and she searches the ground for the breakfast petal, pushes down firmly. It feels like the car is stopping on its own. The wires have gotten too old; it takes them time to talk. She reaches for the keys but they seem jammed into the ignition. Fine. She goes for the seatbelt but Mallory can't push the button hard enough to release the belt. She's too far. A little line of drool is at her mouth but she doesn't know how that happened.\n\nShe pushes again and it doesn't work and that makes her cry. She wanted to go inside and get into bed and maybe even turn out the lights. She wanted to end today the way she did every other one, like tomorrow she would have another one. She wanted to go shopping the next day, buy some oranges maybe or a cake. She liked oranges best. Even when you got old and couldn't eat a lot you could still eat those. She wanted to dream of all this instead of wishing for it, trapped in a car and she thinks there's someone watching her but she can't tell if it's a kid or a grownup or if it's one or three of them.

I was awake for some of them, and then they put me under for others. Just ordinary medical stuff. When they put the electrodes on my forehead it felt a little strange, like I was becoming part of a machine, but the feeling passed after a little.
