=Changes Readers Will Notice=

  * A new look and feel ([http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/example.html example])
  * Readers can now rewind a story to any decision point.
  * Bookmarking now works properly -- any variables that were set in previous passages will be remembered.

=Changes for Authors=

  * The {{{<<tiddler>>}}} macro has been renamed to *{{{<<display>>}}}*.
  * *The {{{<<mask>>}}} macro has been retired.* You can now use the {{{[[text to display|passage]]}}} syntax, or {{{<<choice 'passage' 'text to display'>>}}}.
  * Several special passage names have changed:
    * !SiteTitle is now *!StoryTitle*.
    * !SiteSubtitle is now *!StorySubtitle*.
    * !MainMenu is now *!StoryMenu*.
    * !DefaultTiddlers is now *!StartPassages*.
    * !SiteAuthor is now *!StoryAuthor*.
  * Instead of using a {{{CustomStylesheet}}} passage, you may *tag any passage {{{style}}} to have its CSS added to the document*.
  * The {{{systemConfig}}} tag has been renamed to *{{{script}}}*.
  * *Macros may now define an {{{init}}} method* that will be called after the Jonah code has finished loading. (If you do initialization inside the macro definition itself, it may be called before the Jonah code finishes initializing.)
